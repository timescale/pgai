# pgai

> Supercharge your PostgreSQL database with AI capabilities. Supports automatic creation and synchronization of vector embeddings, seamless vector and semantic search, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) directly in SQL, and ability to call leading LLMs like OpenAI, Ollama, Cohere, and more via SQL.

pgai is a PostgreSQL extension that provides AI capabilities within your database. It consists of two main components:

1. The core PostgreSQL extension which allows you to call various LLM models directly from SQL for tasks like generating content, vector search, and RAG applications.

2. The pgai Vectorizer system which automatically creates and synchronizes vector embeddings for your data using a worker process that runs alongside your database.

The project is maintained by Timescale, a PostgreSQL database company.
