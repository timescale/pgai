## Configure pgai for Ollama

To use pgai with Ollama, Ollama must be running and network-accessible to your database.

To specify the Ollama network address, Ollama functions in pgai use the `_host` parameter. Alternatively, the `ai.ollama_host` config setting can used.
If you do not pass a `_host` argument, and the `ai.ollama_host` config setting is missing. pgai defaults to 
`http://localhost:11434`, and a warning is appended to the log file.

You set the network for your Ollama configuration either:

* Explicitly with the `_host` parameter:

  ```sql
  select ollama_generate
  ( 'llama3'
  , 'what is the typical weather like in Alabama in June'
  , _host=>'http://host.for.ollama:port' -- tells pgai that Ollama is running on the host when pgai is in a docker container
  )
  ```

* Using the `ai.ollama_host` config parameter:

  * At a session level:

    ```sql
    select set_config('ai.ollama_host', 'http://host.for.ollama:port', false);
    ```

  * System-wide, [add it to the postgres.conf file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html#CONFIG-SETTING-CONFIGURATION-FILE)


When Ollama is running on the same host machine as the [Docker container](../README.md#use-a-pre-built-docker-container) 
running pgai, the ollama host address is `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

## Usage

This section shows you how to use AI directly from your database using SQL.

- [List_models](#list-models): list the models supported by OpenAI functions in pgai.
- [Embed](#embed): generate [embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) using a
  specified model.
- [Chat_complete](#chat-complete): generate text or complete a chat.
- [Generate](#generate): generate a response to a prompt
- [List running models](#list-running-models): list the models currently running

### List models

List the models supported by your AI provider in pgai:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM ollama_list_models()
ORDER BY size DESC
;
```
The data returned looks something like the following. However this depends on the models pulled in 
your Ollama instance:

```text
     name      |     model     |    size    |                              digest                              | family | format |     families      | parent_model | parameter_size | quantization_level |          modified_at          
---------------+---------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+-------------------+--------------+----------------+--------------------+-------------------------------
 llava:7b      | llava:7b      | 4733363377 | 8dd30f6b0cb19f555f2c7a7ebda861449ea2cc76bf1f44e262931f45fc81d081 | llama  | gguf   | ["llama", "clip"] |              | 7B             | Q4_0               | 2024-06-17 21:01:26.225392+00
 llama3:latest | llama3:latest | 4661224676 | 365c0bd3c000a25d28ddbf732fe1c6add414de7275464c4e4d1c3b5fcb5d8ad1 | llama  | gguf   | ["llama"]         |              | 8.0B           | Q4_0               | 2024-06-12 21:28:38.49735+00
(2 rows)
```

### Embed

Generate [embeddings](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-embeddings) using a specified model:

```sql
select ollama_embed
( 'llama3'
, 'the purple elephant sits on a red mushroom'
);
```

The data returned looks like:

```text
                      ollama_embed                      
--------------------------------------------------------
    [0.65253496,0.63268006,... 1.5451192,-2.6915514]
(1 row)

```

### Chat complete

[Generate text or complete a chat](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-completion).
You specify custom parameters to the LLM using optional `_options` argument:

```sql
-- the following two metacommands cause the raw query results to be printed
-- without any decoration
\pset tuples_only on
\pset format unaligned

select jsonb_pretty(
  ollama_chat_complete
  ( 'llama3'
  , jsonb_build_array
    ( jsonb_build_object('role', 'system', 'content', 'you are a helpful assistant')
    , jsonb_build_object('role', 'user', 'content', 'Give a short description of what a large language model is')
    )
  , _options=> jsonb_build_object
    ( 'seed', 42
    , 'temperature', 0.6
    )
  )
);
```
The data returned looks like:

```json
{
  "done": true,
  "model": "llama3",
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence designed to process and generate human-like language.

You can use [jsonb operators and functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING)
to manipulate the jsonb object returned from `ollama_chat_complete`:

```sql
-- the following two metacommands cause the raw query results to be printed
-- without any decoration
\pset tuples_only on
\pset format unaligned

select ollama_chat_complete
( 'llama3'
, jsonb_build_array
  ( jsonb_build_object('role', 'system', 'content', 'you are a helpful assistant')
  , jsonb_build_object('role', 'user', 'content', 'Give a short description of what a large language model is')
  )
, _options=> jsonb_build_object
  ( 'seed', 42
  , 'temperature', 0.6
  )
)->'message'->>'content';
```

The data returned looks like:

```text

### Generate

[Generate a response for the prompt provided](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-completion):

```sql
-- the following two metacommands cause the raw query results to be printed
-- without any decoration
\pset tuples_only on
\pset format unaligned

select ollama_generate
( 'llava:7b'
, 'Please describe this image.'
, _images=> array[pg_read_binary_file('/pgai/tests/postgresql-vs-pinecone.jpg')]
, _system=>'you are a helpful assistant'
, _options=> jsonb_build_object
  ( 'seed', 42
  , 'temperature', 0.9
  )
)->>'response'
;
```

The data returned looks like:

```text
 This is a digital image featuring two anthropomorphic characters that appear to be stylized animals. On the left, there's a character that looks like an elephant with boxing gloves on, ready for a fight. The elephant has large ears and eyes, and it's standing upright.

On the right, there's a character that resembles a pine cone. This character is also anthropomorphic, wearing shorts, boots, and a bandana. It holds what looks like a pine cone in each hand.

The background of the image suggests an indoor setting with a wooden floor, a stage with lights, and spectators in the stands. The overall atmosphere of the scene is competitive and energetic. 
```

### List running models

You [list the models currently running in Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#list-running-models) with:

```sql
select *
from ollama_ps()
;
```

The data returned looks like:

```text
   name   |  model   |    size    |                              digest                              | parent_model | format | family |     families      | parameter_size | quantization_level |          expires_at           | size_vram
