# pgai documentation

A Python library that turns PostgreSQL into the retrieval engine behind robust, production-ready RAG and Agentic applications.

- üîÑ Automatically create vector embeddings from data in PostgreSQL tables as well as documents in S3.  The embeddings are automatically updated as the data changes.

- üîç Powerful vector and semantic search with pgvector and pgvectorscale.

- üõ°Ô∏è Production-ready out-of-the-box: Supports batch processing for efficient embedding generation, with built-in handling for model failures, rate limits, and latency spikes.

Works with any PostgreSQL database, including Timescale Cloud, Amazon RDS, Supabase and more.

## pgai install

The pgai python library can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pgai
```

To setup the necessary database functions and tables in your PostgreSQL database, run the following python code:

```python
from pgai
pgai.install(DB_URL)
```

All of the pgai objects are installed into the `ai` schema.

## pgai Vectorizer

Vectorizer automates the embedding process within your database management by treating embeddings as a declarative, DDL-like feature ‚Äî like an index.

 **Overview**: [Automate AI embedding with pgai Vectorizer](vectorizer/overview.md) - a comprehensive overview of Vectorizer features, demonstrating how it streamlines the process of working with vector embeddings in your database.

## pgai extension

The pgai extension is a PostgreSQL extension that performs model calling inside of PostgreSQL. You can find more information about the extension in the [pgai extension directory](/projects/extension/README.md).
