### install via pip

```
pip install pgai
```              

# Quick Start

This section will walk you through the steps to get started with pgai and Ollama using docker and show you the major features of pgai. 

Please note that using Ollama requires a large (>4GB) download of the docker image and model. If you don't want to download so much data, you may want to use the [OpenAI quick start](/docs/vectorizer/quick-start-openai.md) or [VoyageAI quick start](/docs/vectorizer/quick-start-voyage.md) instead.

### Setup

Install PostgreSQL and Ollama if you don't already have them. 

1. **Download the [docker compose file](/examples/docker_compose_pgai_ollama/docker-compose.yml) file.**

    ```
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timescale/pgai/main/examples/docker_compose_pgai_ollama/docker-compose.yml
    ```

1. **Start the docker compose file.**
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```


    This will start Ollama and a PostgreSQL instance. 
  
1. **Download the Ollama models.** We'll use the `all-minilm` model for embeddings and the `tinyllama` model for reasoning.

    ```
    docker compose exec ollama ollama pull all-minilm
    docker compose exec ollama ollama pull tinyllama
    ```

### Create a FastAPI app that performs semantic search and RAG over wikipedia articles

You can take a look at a simple [fastAPI Application](/examples/simple_fastapi_app/with_psycopg.py) to see how to
setup an app to perform RAG with pgai Vectorizer. 

To run the app, first download the file and then you can use the following command:

```
fastapi dev with_psycopg.py
```

By going to ` http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs` you can see the API documentation and try out the endpoints provided by the app.

We'll walk you through the main parts of the code below. 

1. **Enable pgai vectorizer on your database**
    During app startup we run the following Python to install the necessary database object in your PostgreSQL database. All the database objects are installed in the `ai` schema.
    
    ```python
    pgai.install(DB_URL)
    ```
    
    We also run the vectorizer worker as part of the FastAPI app lifecycle. 
    
    ```python
    processor = Processor(DB_URL)
    task = asyncio.create_task(processor.run())
    ```
    
    You can also run the vectorizer worker outside the FastAPI app, in a separate process or separate container. Please see the [vectorizer worker](/docs/vectorizer/worker.md) documentation for more information.
    
1. **Create the table and load the test dataset**

    We'll create a table named `wiki` from a few rows of the english-language `wikimedia/wikipedia` dataset.
    
    First, we'll create the table:

    ```python
    async def create_wiki_table():
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cur:
                await cur.execute("""
                    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wiki (
                        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                        url TEXT NOT NULL,
                        title TEXT NOT NULL,
                        text TEXT NOT NULL
                    )
                """)
            await conn.commit()
    ```

    Then, we'll load the data from the huggingface dataset:
    
    ```python
    async def load_wiki_articles():
        # to keep the demo fast, we have some simple limits
        num_articles = 10
        max_text_length = 1000
        
        wiki_dataset = load_dataset("wikimedia/wikipedia", "20231101.en", split=f"train", streaming=True)
        
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cur:
                for article in wiki_dataset.take(num_articles):
                    await cur.execute(
                        "INSERT INTO wiki (url, title, text) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
                        (article['url'], article['title'], article['text'][:max_text_length])
                    )
                await conn.commit()
    ```
    
1. **Create a vectorizer for `wiki`**

    To enable semantic search on the `text` column of the `wiki` table, we need to create vector embeddings for that column.
    We use a vectorizer to automatically create these embeddings and keep them in sync with the data in the  `wiki` table.
    
    ```python
    async def create_vectorizer():
        vectorizer_statement = CreateVectorizer(
            source="wiki",
            target_table='wiki_embedding_storage',
            loading=LoadingColumnConfig(column_name='text'),
            embedding=EmbeddingOllamaConfig(model='all-minilm', dimensions=384, base_url="http://localhost:11434")
        ).to_sql()
        
        try:
            async with pool.connection() as conn:
                async with conn.cursor() as cur:
                    await cur.execute(vectorizer_statement)
                await conn.commit()
        except Exception as e:
            if "already exists" in str(e):
                # ignore if the vectorizer already exists
                pass
            else:
                raise e
    ```
    
    To learn more about vectorizers, see the [vectorizer usage guide](/docs/vectorizer/overview.md).
    
    The `CreateVectorizer` call is a convenience [sql statement builder](/docs/vectorizer/python-integration.md) that helps you build the sql statement to create the vectorizer. You can find the full reference for the sql `create_vectorizer` call in the [vectorizer API reference](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#create-vectorizers).
    
1. **Check the progress of the vectorizer embedding creation**

    In order for the system to be able to perform batch processing when creating the embeddings, and to be able to 
    recover form intermittent model failures, the vectorizer worker creates embeddings asynchronously in the background.
    To check the progress of the vectorizer embedding creation, we can query the `vectorizer_status` view.
    
    ```python
    @app.get("/vectorizer_status")
    async def vectorizer_status():
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor(row_factory=dict_row) as cur:
                await cur.execute("SELECT * FROM ai.vectorizer_status")
                return await cur.fetchall()
    ```
   
    You can see the progress by going to the `/vectorizer_status` endpoint.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X 'GET' \
        'http://0.0.0.0:8000/vectorizer_status' \
        -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```
    
    All the embeddings have been created when the `pending_items` column is 0. This should be very quick in this demo.
    
1. **Search the embeddings**

    We'll search the embeddings for the concept of "properties of light" even though these words are not in the text of the articles. This is possible because vector embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
    
    Semantic search is a powerful feature in its own right, but it is also a key component of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
    
    We first define a function to find the relevant chunks for a given query. Since we are searching by semantic meaning, a large block of text needs to be broken down into smaller chunks so that the meaning of each chunk is coherent. The vectorizer does this automatically when creating the embeddings and when you search, you get back the chunks that are most relevant to the query.

    ```python
    @dataclass
    class WikiSearchResult:
        id: int
        url: str
        title: str
        text: str
        chunk: str
        distance: float

    async def _find_relevant_chunks(client: ollama.AsyncClient, query: str, limit: int = 2) -> List[WikiSearchResult]:
        response = await client.embed(model="all-minilm", input=query)
        embedding = np.array(response.embeddings[0])
        
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor(row_factory=class_row(WikiSearchResult)) as cur:
                await cur.execute("""
                    SELECT w.id, w.url, w.title, w.text, w.chunk, w.embedding <=> %s as distance
                    FROM wiki_embedding w
                    ORDER BY distance
                    LIMIT %s
                """, (embedding, limit))
                
                return await cur.fetchall()
    ```
     
    This query selects from the `wiki_embedding` view that was created by the vectorizer and which contains all the columns from the `wiki` table plus the `embedding` column which contains the vector embeddings and the `chunk` column which contains the chunked text corresponding to the embedding. In this query, we are returning both the full text of the article and the chunk that is most relevant to the query (different applications may want to return only one or the other).

     The `embedding <=> %s` is a PostgreSQL operator that computes the cosine distance between the stored embedding and the query embedding.
     the greater the distance, the more dissimilar the two vectors are and so we order the results by distance to get the most similar chunks.
    
    This is used in the `/search` endpoint as follows:
    ```python
    @app.get("/search")
    async def search(query: str):
        client = ollama.AsyncClient(host="http://localhost:11434")
        results = await _find_relevant_chunks(client, query)
        return [asdict(result) for result in results]  
    ```
    
    Now you can search through these articles with a query to the search endpoint:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X 'GET' \
        'http://0.0.0.0:8000/search?query=Properties%20of%20Light' \
        -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```
    
 1. **Modify your data and have the vectorizer automatically update the embeddings**
 
    We'll add a row about pgai to the `wiki` table and have the vectorizer automatically update the embeddings. This simulates changes to the underlying data.
    
    ```python
    @app.post("/insert_pgai_article")
    async def insert_pgai_article():
        async with pool.connection() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cur:
                await cur.execute("""
                    INSERT INTO wiki (url, title, text)
                    VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
                """, (
                    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pgai",
                    "pgai - Power your AI applications with PostgreSQL",
                    "pgai is a tool to make developing RAG and other AI applications easier..."
                ))
                await conn.commit()
        return {"message": "Article inserted successfully"}
    ```
    
    Note: The above query inserted the text data into the wiki table without having to do anything to create the embeddings. The vectorizer will automatically create the embeddings for the new row without any intervention from you.  The vectorizer will also automatically update the embeddings for the new row when the data changes.
    
    After a few seconds, you can run a search query related to the new entry and see it returned as part of the results:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X 'GET' \
        'http://0.0.0.0:8000/search?query=AI%20Tools' \
        -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```

1. **Perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

    In this section, we'll have the LLM answer questions about pgai based on the wiki entry we added by using RAG. The LLM was never trained on the pgai wiki entry, and so it needs data in the database to answer questions about pgai.

    The RAG endpoint looks as follows
    
    ```python
    @app.get("/rag")
    async def generate_rag_response(query: str) -> Optional[str]:
        # Initialize Ollama client
        client = ollama.AsyncClient(host="http://localhost:11434")
        
        #find and format the chunks
        chunks = await _find_relevant_chunks(client, query)
        context = "\n\n".join(f"{article.title}:\n{article.text}" for article, _ in chunks)
        logger.debug(f"Context: {context}")
        
        # Construct prompt with context
        prompt = f"""Question: {query}

    Please use the following context to provide an accurate response:

    {context}

    Answer:"""
                
        # Generate response using Ollama SDK
        response = await client.generate(
            model='tinyllama',
            prompt=prompt,
            stream=False
        )
        
        return response['response']
    ```
    
    You can see the RAG response by querying the `/rag` endpoint.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X 'GET' \
        'http://0.0.0.0:8000/rag?query=What%20is%20pgai' \
        -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```
# Features 

Our pgai Python library lets you work with embeddings generated from your data:

* Automatically create and sync vector embeddings for your data using the  ([learn more](/docs/vectorizer/overview.md))
* Search your data using vector and semantic search ([learn more](/docs/vectorizer/overview.md#query-an-embedding))
* Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation as shown above in the [Quick Start](#quick-start)
* Perform high-performance, cost-efficient ANN search on large vector workloads with [pgvectorscale](https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale), which complements pgvector.

We also offer a [PostgreSQL extension](/projects/extension/README.md) that can perform LLM model calling directly from SQL. This is often useful for use cases like classification, summarization, and data enrichment on your existing data.

## A configurable vectorizer pipeline

The vectorizer is designed to be flexible and customizable. Each vectorizer defines a pipeline for creating embeddings from your data. The pipeline is defined by a series of components that are applied in sequence to the data:

- **[Loading](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#loading-configuration):** First, you define the source of the data to embed. It can be the data stored directly in a column of the source table or a URI referenced in a column of the source table that points to a file, s3 bucket, etc.
- **[Parsing](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#parsing-configuration):** Then, you define the way the data is parsed if it is a non-text document such as a PDF, HTML, or markdown file.
- **[Chunking](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#chunking-configuration):** Next, you define the way text data is split into chunks.
- **[Formatting](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#formatting-configuration):** Then, for each chunk, you define the way the data is formatted before it is sent for embedding. For example, you can add the title of the document as the first line of the chunk.
- **[Embedding](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#embedding-configuration):** Finally, you specify the LLM provider, model, and the parameters to be used when generating the embeddings.

## Supported embedding models

The following models are supported for embedding:

- [Ollama](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_ollama)
- [OpenAI](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_openai)
- [Voyage AI](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_voyageai)
- [Cohere](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_litellm)
- [Huggingface](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_litellm)
- [Mistral](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_litellm)
- [Azure OpenAI](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_litellm)
- [AWS Bedrock](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_litellm)
- [Vertex AI](/docs/vectorizer/api-reference.md#aiembedding_litellm)

## The importance of a declarative approach to embedding generation

When you define a vectorizer, you define how an embedding is generated from you
data in a *declarative* way (much like an index).  That allows the system to
manage the process of generating and updating the embeddings in the background
for you. The declarative nature of the vectorizer is the "magic sauce" that
allows the system to handle intermittent failures of the LLM and make the system
robust and scalable.

The approach is similar to the way that indexes work in PostgreSQL. When you
create an index, you are essentially declaring that you want to be able to
search for data in a certain way. The system then manages the process of
updating the index as the data changes.
