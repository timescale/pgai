# Security policy

We aim to keep pgai safe for everyone.
Publicly disclosing security bugs in a public forum can put everyone in the community at risk. Therefore, we ask that
you use the following instructions to report security vulnerabilities.

## Supported versions

The supported version is always the latest major release available in our repository.
We also release regular minor versions with fixes and corrections alongside some new features, as well as patchfix 
releases. Vulnerability fixes are made available as part of these patchfix releases. Best security practice is to 
upgrade to the latest release.

You can also take a look at our [Support Policy](https://www.timescale.com/legal/support-policy).


## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in our software, please email the Timescale Security Team at security@timescale.com.

Only use this e-mail address to report undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Timescale products and services.

Submit regular bug reports as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/timescale/pgai/issues), as _questions_ around security,
compliance, or functionality through customer support or community channels such as 
[Timescale Slack](https://slack.timescale.com/) and the [Forums](https://www.timescale.com/forums).
