-- This sql is the script of blog of Improving Customer Satisfaction in Pizza Shops With RAG: A Pgai Case Study
-- https://www.timescale.com/blog/improving-customer-satisfaction

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The demo of AI RAG by generate a why customer don't like pizza report.
-- The input is 3 records of customer comments to pizza food
-- the output is ai result table with 3 columns:send_message, chat_completion,  final_report
-- the final report columns are markdown formatted business analysis report to why customer don't like pizza

-- the process/tools:
	--- vector database: pgai container for run an store the input, output data
    --- ai model service: openai 'gpt-4o-mini','text-embedding-3-small'
    --- the RAG concept of the process


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 1. Preconfig & Check environment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- clean the history test table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS  PUBLIC.pizza_reviews  CASCADE;   -- CUSTOMER FEEDBACK STORED HERE
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS PUBLIC.pizza_reviews_embeddings CASCADE;  -- CUSTOMER FEEDBACK EMBEDDED 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS  PUBLIC.ai_report CASCADE;      -- THE AI GENERATED BUSINESS REPORT

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ai CASCADE;

-- use openai-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small models for demo purpose. You can use local ollama based on business case
-- make sure the model connection and availability
-- temporary set the api_key
set ai.openai_api_key = 'replace you api key here or use pgai default api_key environment';
select pg_catalog.current_setting('ai.openai_api_key', true) as api_key;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---- step 2 create customer feedback data table and insert the demo data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- the original customer feedback message to food 
CREATE TABLE public.pizza_reviews  (
id bigserial NOT NULL,
product text NOT NULL,
customer_message text NULL,
text_length INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (LENGTH(customer_message)) stored,
CONSTRAINT pizza_reviews_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

--- insert data of pizza_reviews 
INSERT INTO public.pizza_reviews  (product,customer_message) VALUES
	 ('pizza','The best pizza I''ve ever eaten. The sauce was so tangy!'),
	 ('pizza','The pizza was disgusting. I think the pepperoni was made from rats.'),
	 ('pizza','I ordered a hot-dog and was given a pizza, but I ate it anyway.'),
	 ('pizza','I hate pineapple on pizza. It is a disgrace. Somehow, it worked well on this izza though.'),
	 ('pizza','I ate 11 slices and threw up. The pizza was tasty in both directions.');

-- the data of embedding result
CREATE TABLE public.pizza_reviews_embeddings (
id bigserial NOT NULL,
text_id text NOT NULL, 
text_content text NOT NULL, -- it is same as pizza_reviews 
model_name text NOT NULL,
ntoken int4 NULL,
nlength int4 NULL,
embedding public.vector(1536) NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT pizza_reviews_embeddings_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);


-- the ai report for store final customer satisfaction report build by ai.
CREATE TABLE public.ai_report (
	send_message text NULL,
	chat_completion jsonb NULL,
	final_report text NULL,
	create_time timestamptz NULL
);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- step 3. Convert the original customer message to food into vector
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- get embedding result and insert into the embedding table 
with tmp as (
select
	tt.id, tt.customer_message,
	'text-embedding-3-small'::text as model_name,
	openai_embed('text-embedding-3-small',customer_message) as embedding
from
	pizza_reviews  as tt
)
insert into pizza_reviews_embeddings 
		(text_id, text_content, model_name, embedding )
	select 
		id, customer_message, model_name, embedding
	from 
		tmp;

--- create index for query speed optimization. It is optional for small data demo 
CREATE INDEX ON pizza_reviews_embeddings USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists='5');
	

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- step 4. Using AI chat_completion and Database to fast answer busines Question
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- After make the history data into vector table, the new business question could be answered via RAG mod
-- RAG mean convert question to vector and compare it to history data which vectored, find the most similar record.
--- and send to chat_completion for generate business insight report.
--- show the top3  relevant customer message to business question.

-- in demo case, limit 3 is used as criteria of select history data,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
